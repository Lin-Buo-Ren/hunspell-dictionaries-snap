**This is the unofficial snap for Hunspell Dictionaries**, *"Dictionaries for the most popular spellchecking library"*. It works on Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, and other major Linux distributions.

This is a content-shared snap for snaps that depend on the Hunspell spellchecking dictionaries.

This snap does not provide any applications and is not meant for regular users.

Refer [The content interface - doc - snapcraft.io](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/the-content-interface/1074/1) topic for information of using this snap.

## How to Use ##
The consumer snap's snapcraft.yaml must define a counterpart plug for connection:

```yaml
plugs:
  hunspell-dictionaries-plug:
    content: hunspell-dictionaries
    interface: content
    target: $SNAP/usr/share/hunspell
    default-provider: hunspell-dictionaries:hunspell-dictionaries
```

Then do the regular things, except connecting the plug to `hunspell-dictionaries` snap's `hunspell-dictionaries` slot:

    # Install Snap #
    sudo snap install hunspell-dictionaries
    
    # Connect the Snap to the Mandatory Interface #
    ## hunspell-dictionaries: Providing hunspell dictionaries at $SNAP/usr/share/hunspell ##
    sudo snap connect _consumer_snap_name_:hunspell-dictionaries-plug hunspell-dictionaries:hunspell-dictionaries

## What is Working
* Spellchecking in consumer snap (locale tested: fr_FR)

## What is NOT Working...yet 
* Nothing as of now.

## What is NOT Tested...yet
* The launcher script that sets the DICPATH environmental variable (no known snaps depend on it yet.)

... and everything not listed in the "What is Working" section.
